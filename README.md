# TECH1101 - Winter 2020

This `repo` (short for Repository) is for all the course content I create; use it as a resource for your learning. I have found this is easier to keep organized and you may feel that way too. All code I deliver, create or share in class will originate from here.

Additionally if you choose to learn more about Git and Github then you are also welcome to contribute to the code/lessons here via a Pull Request (PR). I've set up a directory with links to howto videos on [Git and Github here:](/master-resources/github)
